# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

**Project Aim:**

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data analytics, specifically exploratory data analysis (EDA), to identify significant patterns and key driver variables that can serve as reliable indicators of a client's potential difficulty in repaying their loan installments. This comprehensive analysis aims to empower the company with actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions regarding loan approvals, risk assessment, and portfolio management. By achieving this aim, we intend to ensure that deserving borrowers are not unjustly rejected while minimizing the company's exposure to risky loans. Additionally, this project aims to enhance our understanding of risk analytics, including the types of variables and their significance, to inform data-driven decision-making in the financial domain.
